Based on linguistic experiments in-formed by native speakers, we distill these ef-fects according to the type of modality and negation. We show that each type has a spe-cific effect on the opinion expression in its scope: both on the polarity and the strength for negation, and on the strength and/or the degree of certainty for modality. The empirical re-sults reported in this paper provide a basis for future opinion analysis systems that have to compute the sentiment orientation at the sen-tence or at the clause level. The methodology we used for deriving this basis was applied for French but it can be easily instantiated for other languages like English.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Automatically identifying findings or diseases described in clinical textual reports requires determining whether clinical observations are present or absent. We evaluate the use of negation phrases and the frequency of negation in free-text clinical reports. METHODS: A simple negation algorithm was applied to ten types of clinical reports (n=42,160) dictated during July 2000. We counted how often each of 66 negation phrases was used to mark a clinical observation as absent. Physicians read a random sample of 400 sentences, and precision was calculated for the negation phrases. We measured what proportion of clinical observations were marked as absent. RESULTS: The negation algorithm was triggered by sixty negation phrases with just seven of the phrases accounting for 90{\%} of the negations. The negation phrases received an overall precision of 97{\%}, with "not" earning the lowest precision of 63{\%}. Between 39{\%} and 83{\%} of all clinical observations were identified as absent by the negation algorithm, depending on the type of report analyzed. The most frequently used clinical observations were negated the majority of the time. CONCLUSION: Because clinical observations in textual patient records are frequently negated, identifying accurate negation phrases is important to any system processing these reports.},

abstract = {Objective: Clinical documents reflect a patient's health status in terms of observations and contain objective information such as descriptions of examination results, diagnoses and interventions. To evaluate this information properly, assessing positive or negative clinical outcomes or judging the impact of a medical condition on patient's well being are essential. Although methods of sentiment analysis have been developed to address these tasks, they have not yet found broad application in the medical domain. Methods and material: In this work, we characterize the facets of sentiment in the medical sphere and identify potential use cases. Through a literature review, we summarize the state of the art in healthcare settings. To determine the linguistic peculiarities of sentiment in medical texts and to collect open research questions of sentiment analysis in medicine, we perform a quantitative assessment with respect to word usage and sentiment distribution of a dataset of clinical narratives and medical social media derived from six different sources. Results: Word usage in clinical narratives differs from that in medical social media: Nouns predominate. Even though adjectives are also frequently used, they mainly describe body locations. Between 12{\%} and 15{\%} of sentiment terms are determined in medical social media datasets when applying existing sentiment lexicons. In contrast, in clinical narratives only between 5{\%} and 11{\%} opinionated terms were identified. This proves the less subjective use of language in clinical narratives, requiring adaptations to existing methods for sentiment analysis. Conclusions: Medical sentiment concerns the patient's health status, medical conditions and treatment. Its analysis and extraction from texts has multiple applications, even for clinical narratives that remained so far unconsidered. Given the varying usage and meanings of terms, sentiment analysis from medical documents requires a domain-specific sentiment source and complementary context-dependent features to be able to correctly interpret the implicit sentiment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of negation in electronic health records is essential if we are to understand the computable meaning of the records: Our objective is to compare the accuracy of an automated mechanism for assignment of Negation to clinical concepts within a compositional expression with Human Assigned Negation. Also to perform a failure analysis to identify the causes of poorly identified negation (i.e. Missed Conceptual Representation, Inaccurate Conceptual Representation, Missed Negation, Inaccurate identification of Negation). METHODS: 41 Clinical Documents (Medical Evaluations; sometimes outside of Mayo these are referred to as History and Physical Examinations) were parsed using the Mayo Vocabulary Server Parsing Engine. SNOMED-C was used to provide concept coverage for the clinical concepts in the record. These records resulted in identification of Concepts and textual clues to Negation. These records were reviewed by an independent medical terminologist, and the results were tallied in a spreadsheet. Where questions on the review arose Internal Medicine Faculty were employed to make a final determination. RESULTS: SNOMED-CT was used to provide concept coverage of the 14,792 Concepts in 41 Health Records from John's Hopkins University. Of these, 1,823 Concepts were identified as negative by Human review. The sensitivity (Recall) of the assignment of negation was 97.2{\%} (p {\textless} 0.001, Pearson Chi-Square test; when compared to a coin flip). The specificity of assignment of negation was 98.8{\%}. The positive likelihood ratio of the negation was 81. The positive predictive value (Precision) was 91.2{\%} CONCLUSION: Automated assignment of negation to concepts identified in health records based on review of the text is feasible and practical. Lexical assignment of negation is a good test of true Negativity as judged by the high sensitivity, specificity and positive likelihood ratio of the test. SNOMED-CT had overall coverage of 88.7{\%} of the concepts being negated.},

abstract = {In today's world, internet is the main origin of information. There are many ecommerce websites available where people discuss on different issues of product. All ecommerce website provide facility to the consumer to give opinion about their product and services. Consumer reviews contain rich and valuable knowledge for both firms and users. The problem with this information is that these reviews are mostly unorganized therefore creating difficulty for information transfer knowledge accession. We propose a product aspect ranking framework, which automatically determine the important aspects of products from online consumer reviews, aiming at improving the usability of the countless reviews. The important aspects are identified by two observations, a) The important aspects of a product are usually given by a large number of consumers; b) And consumers' opinions on the important aspects influence their overall opinions on the product. However Identifying important product aspects will increase the usability of numerous reviews and is useful to both consumers and firms. It is impractical for people to manually identify the important aspects of products from numerous reviews. Consumers can conveniently make purchasing decision by paying more attention to the important aspects, while enterprise can focus on improving the quality of these aspects and thus enhance product ranking effectively},

SemEval-2016 Task 4 comprises five sub-tasks, three of which represent a significant departure from previous editions. The first two subtasks are reruns from prior years and ask to predict the overall sentiment, and the sentiment towards a topic in a tweet. The three new subtasks focus on two variants of the basic " sentiment classification in Twitter " task. The first variant adopts a five-point scale, which confers an ordinal character to the clas-sification task. The second variant focuses on the correct estimation of the prevalence of each class of interest, a task which has been called quantification in the supervised learn-ing literature. The task continues to be very popular, attracting a total of 43 teams.},

abstract = {Twitter is a microblogging platform in which users can post status messages, called “tweets,” to their friends. It has provided an enormous dataset of the so-called sentiments, whose classification can take place through supervised learning. To build supervised learning models, classification algorithms require a set of representative labeled data. However, labeled data are usually difficult and expensive to obtain, which motivates the interest in semi-supervised learning. This type of learning uses unlabeled data to complement the information provided by the labeled data in the training process; therefore, it is particularly useful in applications including tweet sentiment analysis, where a huge quantity of unlabeled data is accessible. Semi-supervised learning for tweet sentiment analysis, although appealing, is relatively new. We provide a comprehensive survey of semi-supervised approaches applied to tweet classification. Such approaches consist of graph-based, wrapper-based, and topic-based methods. A comparative study of algorithms based on self-training, co-training, topic modeling, and distant supervision highlights their biases and sheds light on aspects that the practitioner should consider in real-world applications.},

For the corpus of clinical text, marker words for specula-tion and negation were detected with re-sults in line with previously reported inter-annotator agreement scores. This was also the case for speculation markers in the consumer review corpus, while detection of negation markers was unsuccessful in this genre. Also a setup in which mod-els were trained on markers in consumer reviews, and applied on the clinical text genre, yielded low results. This shows that neither the trained models, nor the choice of appropriate machine learning al-gorithms and features, were transferable across the two text genres.},

Negative qualifier assigned to a medicalcondition may indicate the absence of the condition,so the ability to reliably identify the negation statusof medical concepts affects the quality of resultsproduced by the indexing and search tools.Searching for the best negation algorithm to use inour negation module for the suite of NLP tools, wemodified two existing regular expression-basedalgorithms in an attempt to improve theirperformance, and created two classification-basedmethods. The classification-based algorithms weretrained on 1745 discharge reports from a Boston-based hospital. The algorithms were evaluated on100 randomly-chosen outpatient reports from twodifferent Boston-based hospitals, and the results werecompared to the gold standard created by twoindependent human reviewers.The regular expression and syntactic processing-based algorithms appeared to have better agreement(Kappa = 0.77 to 0.79) with the human reviewersthan the classification-based algorithms (Kappa =0.57 to 0.75).

abstract = {With the booming of microblogs on the Web, people have begun to express their opinions on a wide variety of topics on Twitter and other similar services. Sentiment analysis on entities (e.g., products, organizations, people, etc.) in tweets (posts on Twitter) thus becomes a rapid and effective way of gauging public opinion for business marketing or social studies. However, Twitter's unique characteristics give rise to new problems for current sentiment analysis methods, which originally focused on large opinionated corpora such as product reviews. In this paper, we propose a new entity-level sentiment analysis method for Twitter. The method first adopts a lexicon- based approach to perform entity-level sentiment analysis. This method can give high precision, but low recall. To improve recall, additional tweets that are likely to be opinionated are identified automatically by exploiting the information in the result of the lexicon-based method. A classifier is then trained to assign polarities to the entities in the newly identified tweets. Instead of being labeled manually, the training examples are given by the lexicon-based approach. Experimental results show that the proposed method dramatically improves the recall and the F-score, and outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.
